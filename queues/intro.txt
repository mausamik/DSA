QUEUES  

-collection Framework of java 
-Interface 

- Linear Data Structure
- FIFO --> First In First OUT 


 Insertion (rear / begin  end ) --> |   |    |     |     |    |    |   <-- Deletion  (front / end end)

 4 major operations 
  --> 2 pointers  -- front & rear 
     1. enqueue(ele) -- insert element at the top (rear++)
     2. dequeue() -- removes the top element 
     3. peekfirst() -- gets the 1st element 
     4. peeklast() -- gets the last element 
     5. isEmpty() -- rear == 0   -- insert elements then / cannot delete elements 
     5. isFull() -- rear == size of queue -- cannot add more ele 


Time complexity : O(1) -- for all operations 

Applications:
     CPU / Disk Scheduling - Round robin , FIFO , Multiqueue 
     Maintaining Playlist 
     Interrupt Handling 


Disadvantages 
     Insertion / Deletion only from rear/ front end 
     Not much flexible
