STACK 

- inbuilt class in Java 

- Linear Data Structure 
- LIFO --> Last In First Out 

- Insertion , Deletion from the top 

4 major operations 

1. push(ele) -- insert into stack 
2. pop()  -- delete the top element 
3. isEmpty() -- return true if stack is isEmpty
4. peek() -- returns the top of stack 


time complexity -- O(1)  for all operations

Applications :
    Recursion 
    Parsing 
    Browsers 
    Editors 


Disadvantages :
     whatever operations are done are limited to the top of stack
