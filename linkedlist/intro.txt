LINKED LIST 

    - Singlular 
    - Double 
    - Circular 

- Linear Data Structure 
- access ele in linear fashion  only 
- store similar elements(int , double , float ...)
- Dynamic in size 
- Starting element or node --> head 
- Easy Insertion & Deletion (anywhere)

Implementation :
    Insert at beginning 
    Insert at the end 

    Delete 

    Display 

    Other methods 

Applications:
    Suitable for Dyanamic memory applications 
    Frequent Insertion / Deletion 

Disadvantages:
    if head node lost, linked list holds no importance 
    No random access , as the nodes has address of other nodes 


Time complexity :
     Insert --> O(1)
     Search --> O(n) 


Remaining topics :
    Double 
    Circular
